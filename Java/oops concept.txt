1.Object:
Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. 
For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.

2.Class:
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.

3.Inheritence:
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. 
It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

4.Polymorphism:
If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. 
For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.

5.Abrstraction:
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction.
 For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

6.Encapulation
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. 
For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
